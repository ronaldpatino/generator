# generator
A JavaFX CRUD code generator usign Hibernate and Apache Velocity

Still WIP code is messy.

I'm using:

Maven

Hibernate

MySql as DB

Apache Velocity for the templates.

afterburner.fx

jfoenix

ikonli

javax.validation

It currently creates the CRUD screens based upon the test.json descriptor file. The file generator.sql holds a sample mysql schema.

Generated code still needs a bit of tweaking in order to run
